## Description

I managed to get the app top work, due to alot of the code was in the oast modules. I had to just tweak the code a bit to try and fit this challange. I had it a major issue with deploying my app. i think it had something to do with the webpack, because I had been just trying to get the code to work for the cache and trying to firgure out the offline feature. However I manged to get it to work locally so I am proud of that.
